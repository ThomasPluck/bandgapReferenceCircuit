    "### Circuit Design\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Bandgap Design\n",
    "Read this paper: \n",
    "H. Banba et al., \"A CMOS bandgap reference circuit with sub-1-V operation,\" in IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits, vol. 34, no. 5, pp. 670-674, May 1999, doi: 10.1109/4.760378.\n",
    "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/760378\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to characterize the bipolar device in the PDK in order to know the temperature coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Remaining Circuit Design\n",
    "a. The amplifier is the source of loop gain in a feedback control loop. Check outo the small signal form to see negative feedback.\n",
    "*Thought Provoking Question:* The amplifier is differential so there are two loops, negative and positive, from input to output. Why does one loop need a capacitor on it? How would removing the capacitor affect stability?\n",
    "b. The amplifier is self-biased. You should work out, with the square law model and extracted model parameters, what is the dc voltage of the amplifier output? This node is the same as the current mirror input, which feeds into another current mirror. What is the relationship between the output dc voltage from an input dc common mode voltage? The range of that function impacts headroom of the amplifier.\n",
    "c. The circuit requires start-up circuitry for *reliable* startup. Think about how this is a primitive digital control bit. \n",
    "\n",
    "My design can be understood through particular attention to tsmc_bandgap_real.sch. You need xschem with the xschem skywater-130 library to really read this file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tools I used for design are \n",
    "pyMOSchar/characterize.py to characterize NFET and PFET devices,\n",
    "pyMOSchar/lookupMOS.py to use look-up tables of small signal parameters for many arrayed values of VGS, VDS, VSB, W, L. Another file, pyMOSchar/lookupExamples.py, may also help.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it. I hope you have fun! The rest of the repository is related to the bandgap I personally taped out during Stanford's Tapeout Series (https://priyanka-raina.github.io/teaching/)"
